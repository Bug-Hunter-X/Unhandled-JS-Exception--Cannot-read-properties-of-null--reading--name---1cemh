This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or when components render before data has fully loaded.

```javascript
// Example: Trying to access a property of a null object
const myComponent = () => {
  const [userData, setUserData] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData().then(setUserData);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{userData.name}</Text>  // Error if userData is still null
    </View>
  );
};
```
